## Configuration

### Adding or editing categories

Open `categorizer.py` and edit the `CATEGORIES` dictionary:

```python
CATEGORIES = {
    "🏠 House & Billing": ["שכירות", "ארנונה", "חשמל", ...],
    "🍎 Groceries": ["שופרסל", "רמי לוי", ...],
    "🐾 Pets": ["וטרינר", "petshop"],
}
```

Transactions that don't match any keyword land in **❓ Other**. Check that
section in the report — if you see recurring descriptions there, add their
keywords to the right category.

### Special rules

- A check (`שיק`) or digital transfer (`העברה דיגיטל`) of approximately
  ₪4,500 is automatically classified as rent (House & Billing).
- Other checks and transfers go to the `💸 Transactions` category.
- Credit card payment lines in the bank statement (`לאומי ויזה`,
  `כרטיסי אשראי`) are excluded from spending totals to avoid double counting
  with the detailed card transactions.

### Billing month

The billing month runs from the 15th of one month to the 14th of the next.
Transactions on or after the 15th of May are billed in June. This matches
how Leumi credit card cycles work. Change the `cutoff_day` parameter in
`core/period.py` if you need a different cycle.
